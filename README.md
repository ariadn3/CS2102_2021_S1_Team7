# CS2102 AY20/21 Database Systems Project (Team 7)

Static FlaskApp is deployed and updated. To run, clone the git and open terminal and go to the FlaskApp directory. Then call python app.py then open your localhost:5000\registration to register. do note that you will need to connect it to postgres yourself. (Not very sure how it works with different computers, may want to update app.py if there are any issues)

Preliminary constraints and ER diagrams can be found in the 'erd' branch of the repo

We're working on the website frontend right now.
