Hi Group 7,

The comment for your group is given below:
Comments

--> try to minimize crossing of lines (if possible)
= Okay, we tried

- A normal user has a profile picture, name, location, H/P number, and email.
--> non-critical, but profile picture may take time to implement
    and is email a candidate key?
    if so, do be careful with the implementation
= Removed profile pic for user
= We'll stick to ID for logins, emails have to be unique.

A pet has a profile picture, birthday, name, special requests and a pet ID.
    A pet can be uniquely identified with its pet ID. (Weak entity - existential dependency)
==> Why not ID dependency and no need for pet ID
    an owner cannot have two pets with the same name?
= An owner might have two pets with the same name,
= But make it simpler, name is now identifier, remove petID

The salaries can be uniquely identified by the year, month and the care taker's user ID. (Weak entity - identity dependency) (Can be derived with the main transaction table later, but created for caching purposes)
--> since it seems to be computed, make sure to take care of consistency
= Noted with thanks

** this comment is for period (related to both)
A part-timer can indicate his/her availabilities for a period, comprising of a start and end date (inclusive)
A full-timer can indicate his/her leave periods, comprising of a start and end date (inclusive)
==> The definition of "period" seems to be conflicting
    is it availability period or unavailability (leave) period?
    this is then associated to the "looking after"
    
    So, is it intended to be a multi-purpose entity set?
    or is it intended to have a meaning that it connect the "availability"/"leave" (i.e., to be able to find information about care taker availability)?
    
    If it is the former, then ignore this comment.
    If it is the latter, then need to adjust the meaning accordingly.
= Multi-purpose entity

Pet owner - Pets
--> is this the owning entity set?
    if so, might be better to use "EX Owns" to indicate existential dependency since there is two ==> arrows out of "pet"
= Renaming 'Owns' to 'EX Owns'

There is only one admin account
--> why?
= For simplicity, we can always relax this afterwards

[5 marks]

Cheers,
Adi
